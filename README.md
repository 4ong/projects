TODO:
  * show messages on mobile / narrow screens
  * add a topic list view to show tasks in topological order (+indent the dependers a little)
  * use message bus to notify other users of changes
  * add revision capability for project tasks
  * add support for subprojects (one subproject will be a task in one project but also its own category)
  * make the UI more beautiful (links instead of buttons etc)
  * write tests
